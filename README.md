This code snippet is a Python program that utilizes the Matplotlib library to create a bar chart visualizing the number of Internet users by continent. Here’s a concise synopsis of its functionality:

Imports: The code begins by importing the pyplot module from the Matplotlib library, which is essential for generating plots and visualizations.

Data Preparation: Sample data representing Internet users in millions is defined for six continents—Asia, Europe, North America, Africa, South America, and Oceania. The respective number of users for each continent is stored in a list.

Bar Chart Creation:

A figure of specified size (12x6 inches) is created to hold the bar chart.
A bar chart is plotted using the continents as the x-axis labels and the number of Internet users as the heights of the bars. Different colors with transparency (alpha) are assigned to each bar for visual distinction.
Titles and Labels: The plot is titled "Growth of Internet Users by Continent," with appropriate labels for the x-axis ("Continents") and y-axis ("Number of Internet Users (in millions)") to enhance readability.

Data Labels: The code iterates over each bar to retrieve its height and places the corresponding user count as a label above each bar, improving the chart's informational value.

Legend: A legend indicating that the bars represent Internet users is added, though it might be redundant since the context is clear.

Grid Lines: Horizontal grid lines are added to the y-axis for better visual guidance when interpreting bar heights.

Layout Adjustment and Display: The layout is optimized for tight fitting (using tight_layout()), and the plot is displayed to the user with plt.show().

Overall, this program effectively visualizes the disparity in Internet users across different continents using a clear and informative bar chart format.
